# 🌱 Worlds in Grey
Worlds in Grey is an educational puzzle-platformer developed for PC using Unity, designed to advocate for climate action in support of SDG 13. Set in a post-apocalyptic world devastated by human neglect, the game follows a robot named T3rr4 who journeys through five distinct environments—ranging from ruined forests to polluting factories—to solve puzzles and plant vegetation, transforming the "grey" world back into a colored, living ecosystem. The narrative emphasizes environmental stewardship, culminating in T3rr4's self-sacrifice to fully restore the Earth's ecological balance and save the remaining life on the planet.
